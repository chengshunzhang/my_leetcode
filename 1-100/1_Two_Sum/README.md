## 1. Binary Search  
Sort the array. For each element, use binary search to find whether they add up to target and check whether it is the number self.  

## 2. HashMap  
Iterate over the `nums` array, each time calculate the difference and check whether the difference is in HashMap. The HashMap maps the value to position.
