First check whether x is smaller than 0 and whether ending with 0 except 0 itself. If so, return false.  
While loop to inversely construct an int from x. Stop when x is smaller than x_inv. If x is equal to x_inv (even number of digits) or x is equal to x_inv / 10 (odd number of digits), return true. Otherwise, return false.
