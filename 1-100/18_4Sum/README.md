### Two pointers  
Basically the same as 3sum, just adding one more outer loop.  
One thing to notice is that in order to remove duplicates, when the sum is target, increase left pointer until get a new value and decrease right pointer until get a new value. And at the end of each outer loop (i and j), increase until get new values.
